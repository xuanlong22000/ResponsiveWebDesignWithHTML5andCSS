                Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate,
                and release wildlife back into their natural environment. 
                We are a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We
                also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back
                into their natural environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care
                for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a
                sponsor. Contact us today.
